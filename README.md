# Project Title
HireSwift

## Overview

A job portal where each posting is capped at 10 applications, then closed for review, with the option to reopen if no suitable candidates are found.

### Problem

The recruitment industry faces challenges with overwhelming numbers of applications per job posting, leading to inefficiencies in the hiring process. Recruiters often spend excessive time sifting through numerous resumes, many of which are not a good fit, resulting in delayed hiring decisions and missed opportunities for both employers and qualified candidates. This app addresses the need for a streamlined process that limits applications to ensure quality over quantity, enabling more effective review, quicker decision-making, and a better match between employers and job seekers.

### User Profile

Recruiters: They use the app to post jobs, review up to 10 applications per posting, select preferred candidates, or reopen the job posting if necessary.
Job Seekers: They use the app to find and apply to exclusive job opportunities, benefiting from a higher chance of their application being reviewed due to the application limit.

### Features

For Job Seekers:

As a job seeker, I want to be able to create an account so I can apply for jobs.
As a job seeker, I want to be able to login to my account to manage my applications.
As a job seeker, I want to apply for a job with a single click, with details.

For Recruiters:

As a recruiter, I want to be able to create an account to post job openings.
As a recruiter, I want to be able to login to my account to manage my job postings.
As a recruiter, I want to post a job with details such as job title, description, required skills, location, and industry.
As a recruiter, I want to review applications limited to the first 10 submissions, to ensure quality over quantity.
As a recruiter, I want to be able to close the job posting automatically after receiving 10 applications, with an option to reopen it if needed.
As a recruiter, I want to select preferred candidates from the applications received and notify them of the next steps.
As a recruiter, if no suitable candidates are found, I want the option to reactivate the job posting for additional applications.
